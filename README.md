Data Analysis Portfolio – Summary

This project brings together three different analyses – books, happiness and media ratings. Each dataset has its own detailed README, but this file gives you a quick idea of what’s inside.

📖 Goodreads (Books)

I looked at popular books on Goodreads to see what makes them stand out. Fiction, Fantasy and Young Adult are the top genres and most highly-rated books fall around the 3.9–4.0 range. Author reputation also seems to play a big role in how visible a book becomes.

😊 World Happiness

Using the World Happiness dataset, I explored what drives happiness across countries. Factors like GDP and social support strongly boost scores, while corruption pulls them down. Interestingly, some middle-income countries rank higher than expected, showing happiness isn’t only about money.

🎬 Media (Movies, TV & Books)

Here I compared ratings across movies, TV shows and books. Movies often get mixed reviews, books are more stable, and TV sits somewhere in between. Genres like sci-fi and drama consistently do well, while some “big name” titles don’t always live up to expectations.

🚀 Takeaway

Whether it’s books, happiness or media, one thing stands out: community trust, reputation and strong niches matter more than just popularity or money.
